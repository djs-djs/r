# Question 13.2

# In this problem you, can simulate a simplified airport security system at a 
# busy airport. Passengers arrive according to a Poisson distribution with 
# λ1 = 5 per minute (i.e., mean interarrival rate μ1 = 0.2 minutes) to the 
# ID/boarding-pass check queue, where there are several servers who each have 
# exponential service time with mean rate μ2 = 0.75 minutes. [Hint: model them 
# as one block that has more than one resource.] After that, the passengers are 
# assigned to the shortest of the several personal-check queues, where they go 
# through the personal scanner (time is uniformly distributed between 0.5 
# minutes and 1 minute). Use the Arena software (PC users) or Python with 
# SimPy (PC or Mac users) to build a simulation of the system, and then 
# vary the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues to 
# determine how many are needed to keep average wait times below 15 minutes. 
# [If you’re using SimPy, or if you have access to a non-student version of 
# Arena, you can use λ1 = 50 to simulate a busier airport.]
