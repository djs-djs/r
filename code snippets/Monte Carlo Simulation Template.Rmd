#Monte Carlo simulation on this vector representing the countries of the 8 runners in this race.
#For each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation, select 3 runners representing the 3 medalists and check whether they are all from Jamaica. Repeat this simulation 10,000 times. Set the seed to 1 before running the loop. Then calculate the probability that all the runners are from Jamaica.

set.seed(1)
runners <- c("Jamaica", "Jamaica", "Jamaica", "USA", "Ecuador", "Netherlands", "France", "South Africa")
B <- 10000
all_jamaica <- replicate(B, {
  results <- sample(runners, 3)
  all(results == "Jamaica")
})
mean(all_jamaica)
